* Vagrant environment

To try out environment run the following:

vagrant up
vagrant ssh
cd /vagrant ; rm -rf node_modules ; npm install
npm start

Note: npm start will fail, if you have installed node modules outside vagrant environment and vice versa. That's why we remove node_modules folder on init.
